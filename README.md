# Email templates for my projects

Uses [MJML](https://mjml.io/documentation/). See a demo of MJML [here](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/).

## Why open source this?

Because it can help someone.

## Running

```sh
npm run start
```

## Changelog

- The old template at `devletters/letters.mjml` was copied to `aviaryan.com/email-v1-centered.mjml` since it is now my personal newsletter.
- Only the template I am currently using is included in the build scripts.
