# Email templates for my projects

Uses [MJML](https://mjml.io/documentation/). See a demo of MJML [here](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/).

## Why open source this?

Because it can help someone.

## Running

```sh
npm run start
```

## Notes

The old template at `devletters/letters.mjml` was copied to `aviaryan.com/newsletter.mjml` since it is now my personal newsletter. Therefore `devletters/*.mjml` is also excluded in the build.
